        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <b>Smokestack BBQ</b>– where smoke, fire, and flavor come together to create unforgettable meals. Our story starts with a simple belief: great barbecue is more than just food — it's a tradition. It’s about gathering with family and friends, slow-cooked meats kissed by wood smoke, secret sauces passed down through generations, and southern hospitality that makes you feel right at home.
            At Smokestack BBQ, we stay true to the roots of American barbecue while bringing our own bold twist. Our pitmasters use time-honored techniques, real hardwood, and a whole lot of patience. Whether it's our 16-hour smoked brisket, fall-off-the-bone ribs, or our signature pulled pork sandwiches, everything is made with care — low and slow, the way it should be.
            But barbecue is just the beginning. We’ve built a place where the food is honest, the portions are generous, and the vibes are always good. Cold drinks, warm service, and a little bit of country soul — that’s what you’ll find here.
            Whether you’re a first-time visitor or part of the Smokestack family, we’re proud to serve you and share our love of barbecue, one plate at a time.
